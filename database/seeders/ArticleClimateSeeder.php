Melting glaciers and polar ice are not just raising sea levels but disrupting entire ecological systems. As habitats shift, wildlife is being forced into unfamiliar and often dangerous territories. Instances like gray whales navigating into hazardous zones reflect a deeper ecological imbalance.\n\nSimultaneously, thawing Arctic permafrost is releasing vast reserves of ancient carbon, accelerating global warming in a dangerous feedback loop. These developments reinforce a stark reality: climate change is not linear—it is amplifying itself."
