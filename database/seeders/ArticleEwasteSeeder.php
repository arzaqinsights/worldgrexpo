From obsolete smartphones to end-of-life batteries, electronic waste (e-waste) has become the fastest-growing waste stream globally. As of early 2026, the numbers are staggering: 62 million tonnes of e-waste generated in 2022, projected to reach a massive 82 million tonnes by 2030. Yet, beneath this growing crisis lies an extraordinary opportunity—a multi-billion-dollar resource pool waiting to be unlocked."

This means nearly 80% of discarded electronics are either dumped, traded, or processed informally, leading to severe environmental and health risks.\n\nWhat makes this gap even more alarming is the pace: e-waste is increasing five times faster than recycling efforts. This imbalance is not just a sustainability issue—it is an economic loss of immense proportions."

Embedded within discarded electronics are critical raw materials (CRMs) such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, gold, and palladium—materials essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and digital infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022 alone, the estimated value of recoverable materials in global e-waste stood between $62 billion and $91 billion. Shockingly, only about $28 billion worth of materials was actually recovered, leaving a vast untapped opportunity for businesses, investors, and governments.\n\nThis is where urban mining is redefining the recycling industry—transforming landfills into resource hubs and waste streams into profit streams."
